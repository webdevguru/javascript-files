In programming, an API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications use to interact with each other. They are commonly used to access web services, databases, or other software systems, making it easier to integrate different functionalities without needing to know the internal workings of each part.

For example, in web development, APIs are used to fetch data from a server and display it on a webpage. A popular type of API in web development is the REST API (Representational State Transfer), which uses HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources on a server.

Here's a basic example of using the Fetch API to retrieve data in JavaScript


fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
In this code:

fetch makes an HTTP request to the specified URL.
.then(response => response.json()) processes the response and converts it to JSON format.
.then(data => console.log(data)) handles the JSON data.
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error)) handles any errors that occur.
APIs are central to modern applications because they enable modular and reusable code, making complex integrations simpler.
